# Built with Node and React

This repo contains a blog project built out in a micro services architecture pattern.
It uses React as the frontend library. On the backend it uses Node.js, Express, Docker, and Kubernates.

It followes an event driven architecture where each individual service works together but is not dependent on each other.

The application flow is broken up into logical "services" and each micro service is responsible for it's own functionality without having to rely on the performance of the other related servives.
